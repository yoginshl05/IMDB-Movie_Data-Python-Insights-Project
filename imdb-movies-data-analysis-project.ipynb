    "5. Now that you have 3 dataframes performed by grouping over genre_1, genre_2, and genre_3 separately, it's time to combine them. For this, add the three dataframes and store it in a new dataframe df_add, so that the corresponding values of Votes/CVotes get added for each genre.There is a function called add() in pandas which lets you do this. You can refer to this link to see how this function works. https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.4/generated/pandas.DataFrame.add.html\n",
    "6. The column cnt on aggregation has basically kept the track of the number of occurences of each genre.Subset the genres that have atleast 10 movies into a new dataframe genre_top10 based on the cnt column value.\n",
    "7. Now, take the mean of all the numeric columns by dividing them with the column value cnt and store it back to the same dataframe. We will be using this dataframe for further analysis in this task unless it is explicitly mentioned to use the dataframe movies.\n",
    "8. Since the number of votes can't be a fraction, type cast all the CVotes related columns to integers. Also, round off all the Votes related columns upto two digits after the decimal point."
